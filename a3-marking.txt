Functionality/Design  [/30]

(a) Signaling system: 10

   [/1] - setsup default behaviour
   [/1] - syskill implementation - 
   [/1] - syssighandler
   [/1] - sigreturn
   [/2] - building of stack - prioritizing signals - blocking out
   [/1] - sleeping process
   [/1] - process doing a read
   [/1] - processes in system calls
   [/1] - trampoline setup/code


(b) Keyboard: [/15]
   [/1] - Device table
   [/1] - FD in PCB
   [/1] - DII open hunting down FD etc 
   [/1] - DII close - returning FD slot for use
   [/1] - DII read 
   [/1] - DII write

     Keyboard specific
   [/1] - open - 1 keyboard mode 
   [/1] - close - cleans up and allows keyboard to be reused
   [/1] - write - should be failure
   [/1] - read handles buffer filling
   [/1] - read on empty buffer
   [/1] - read returns upon carriage return 
   [/1] - handles EOF properly
   [/1] - uses interrupts 
   [/1] - can produce capital letters


(c) Test Program: [/5]
      [/1] - handles echo mode 
      [/1]- handles non-echo mode  
      [/1] - signal handling (ignores 20 handles 18)
      [/1] - deals with EOF properly 
      [/1] - interrupt of a read by a signal

 Coding Style  Documentation 


(a)Code Clarity: [/10]
     [/2] prototypes declared in kernel.h
     [/2] Signal handling properly commented
     [/1] Device independent code has reasonable
       and consistent structure
     [/1] Keyboard device specific code is well structured
     [/2] Code has reasonable layout and indentation
     [/2] Structure fields of device table and file
       descriptor table in PCB appropriately
       commented

(b) Function Descriptions: [/5]
     3 System calls have comments describing
       arguments and return values
     2 Other major functions have descriptions

Test Cases: 1 points each total of [/10]. 

The output was to handed in, in a file named testdoc.txt. For the 1
mark each test must be appropriately delineated and identified. There
needs to be a description of what the test is supposed to show and
what it does (0.5 mark). There should be test output and
interpretation of the results (0.5 mark). The tests do not have to be
passed. The 10 test cases are as follows:


1. Test showing prioritization of signals
2. sighandler() test case
3. sigkill() test case
4. syssigwait() test case
5. sysopen() with invalid arguments
6. syswrite() with an invalid file file descriptor
7. sysioctl() test for invalid commands
8. sysread() when there are more characters buffered in 
   kernel than the read requests
9. Two test cases for scenarios not covered here or in the test program.


Git/Stash [/3] marks.  
   3 marks if regular commits  1 mark if less than 5 commits.
